It's dark. You find yourself soaked, and laying in soiled dirt. The air around you is musty, and 
something is obscuring the view of the stars above. It's cold, and there's a drip echoing somewhere
in the distance. It's a cave. The cold draft of damp air is brushing your back, finding its way 
under your wet coat, to chill you to the bone.

There's a sound; a small fluttering, and a faint glow moving in the dark, allowing minute angles
of the cavernous walls to reflect the water running down, sporadically and seemingly randomly.
